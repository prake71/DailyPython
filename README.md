# My Daily Portion of Python

What's one of the best ways to learn a (programming) language?
Practice!

This repository is my attempt to improve my Python skills to the point
where I no longer need to constantly look things up. I want
programming to feel more natural and fluent—much like speaking a
foreign language. It’s just more enjoyable when you don’t have to
consult Google or a dictionary for every little thing.

So, I’ve decided to write a bit of Python every day. For that, I
needed small exercises to work on, and I found plenty at
[w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-basic-exercises.php). They
offer thousands of problems — just the Python Basics
section alone has over 2,100 exercises! At a pace of one per day,
that’s enough to keep me busy for nearly six years.

Let’s see how far I get! :-)

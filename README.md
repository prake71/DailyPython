# My Daily Portion of Python

What might be one of the best ways to learn a (programming) language? 
Practice!

This repository is my try to get my Python programming skills to a
level where I don't need to look up everything, so that programming
feels more fluent. It's also like speaking natural languages - it
feels better and is more convenient if you don't have to ask google
for every translation or look in a dictionary. 

So, I decided to program a little bit of Python every day. For that I
needed small little exercises which I found at
[w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-basic-exercises.php).
There are thousands of exercises available. Python Basics only are
already 2100 exercises - this will keep me occupied for almost six
years, if I would do one of them daily.

Let's see, how far I come :-)

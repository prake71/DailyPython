2. Python Version Checker

Write a Python program to find out what version of Python you are using.

import sys

# Knowing your Python version is crucial to ensure that your code runs
# as expected. If you’re using a feature that’s only available in a
# newer version, your code won’t run on an older version. Here’s how
# you can check your Python version:


print(sys.version)
